-- 8/1: 
deferred project supply account (DPSA):
Two Main Sources of Accrual:
Project contributions to Keno flows (substitute for Link Dam releases)
Foregone UKL refuge supply (diverted drainage/refuge water instead)
Conditions for DPSA Accrual:
Keno impoundment is balanced
UKL is not in flood control
Accumulation period: Nov 1 – Sep 30 (no Oct accrual)
Spill and Use Logic:
Spills:
DPS spills before FFA during flood events
Spill formula accounts for dam flows minus refuge/project diversions
Use:
DPS used in Ag diversion according to rules
Refuge can divert DPS in flood operations

Summary:
Credits (adds water):
Flow savings: When Lost River or pump water helps meet river flow targets, saving UKL water.
Debits (subtracts water):
Irrigation use: When farms use water from DPSA.
Refuge use: When refuges actually use the saved water.

When is DPSA Active?
It starts fresh on November 1 every year.
October is excluded — no accumulation or carryover.
It operates daily from November 1 to September 30.

Spills: If UKL floods, some DPSA water may be lost to the river.
Refuge savings: If the refuges don’t need all their allocated UKL water.
DPSA_today = DPSA_yesterday
           + water saved from Project/refuge flow contributions
           - water used by irrigators
           - water used by refuges
           - water spilled from UKL

Current Dans Riverware Version:
Adds flow savings
Subtracts spills
But misses irrigation and refuge use

Flowwest version: 
Lake Data misses DPS Spill 
Added Customized DPS Spil slot to Lake Data


TODOS:
any missing data trace back to R spreadsheet - found UKL spill value in Alt_Tables in R workbook
